1)Import the required classes for file handling (BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, File, FileReader, FileWriter), and also import Scanner for user input.
2)Define the main class File_Handling.
3)Define the main method:
  Specify that the method might throw an IOException.
4)Define the file path for the input file (filePath).
  Create a Scanner object (sc) for user input.
5)Display a message asking the user to enter the word they want to find (word1).
  Display a message asking the user to enter the word they want to replace it with (word2).
6)Create an instance of File for the input file (inputFile).
  Create an instance of File for the temporary output file (tempFile).
7)Create a BufferedReader (reader) to read from the input file.
   Create a BufferedWriter (writer) to write to the temporary output file.
8)Initialize a variable currentLine to hold the content of the current line read from the input file.
  Use a while loop to read each line from the input file until there are no more lines left.
13)Inside the loop:
  Replace occurrences of word1 with word2 in the currentLine.
  Write the modified line to the temporary output file using the writer.
  Print a message indicating that the text has been changed successfully.
14)After the loop completes, close the BufferedReader (reader) and the BufferedWriter (writer).
15)Close the Scanner (sc).
