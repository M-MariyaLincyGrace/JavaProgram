1)Import necessary classes from the java.time package, including LocalDateTime, DateTimeFormatter, and ChronoUnit.

2)Create a Scanner object to read user input.

3)Prompt the user to enter a date and time in the format "DD-MM-YYYY hh:mm".

4)Define a DateTimeFormatter object to parse the input string using the specified pattern "dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm".

5)Attempt to parse the user input into a LocalDateTime object using the formatter. If the parsing fails, output "Invalid date." and exit the program.

6)Get the current date and time using LocalDateTime.now().

7)Calculate the difference between the input date and time and the current date and time using ChronoUnit methods such as YEARS.between(), MONTHS.between(), WEEKS.between(), DAYS.between(), and MINUTES.between().

8)For each unit of time difference (years, months, weeks, days, minutes), check if the difference is greater than 0. If it is, print the difference along with the corresponding unit.

9)If no positive difference is found in the above checks, print "Invalid date."
