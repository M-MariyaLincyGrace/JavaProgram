1)Import necessary classes including BufferedReader, FileReader, IOException, and HashSet.

2)Define a class named DataComparison with the main method.

3)Inside the main method:
 a. Call the readEmailsFromFile method twice to read email addresses from two files, file1.txt and file2.txt.
 b. Create a HashSet named commonEmails by copying the contents of file1Emails and then retaining only the common elements with file2Emails.
 c. Print the email addresses present in both files.
 d. Create a HashSet named uniqueFile1Emails by copying the contents of file1Emails and then removing the elements present in file2Emails.
 e. Print the email addresses present in file1 but not in file2.
 f. Create a HashSet named uniqueFile2Emails by copying the contents of file2Emails and then removing the elements present in file1Emails.
 g. Print the email addresses present in file2 but not in file1.
 h. Create a HashSet named allUniqueEmails by combining the contents of both file1Emails and file2Emails.
 i. Print all unique email addresses present in both files.

4)Define the readEmailsFromFile method that takes a filename as input and returns a HashSet of email addresses.
 a. Initialize an empty HashSet named emails.
 b. Use a BufferedReader to read each line from the file.
 c. Add each line (email address) to the emails set.
 d. Handle any IOException by printing the stack trace.
 e. Return the emails set.
